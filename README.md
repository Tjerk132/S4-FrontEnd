## Running the tests

The automated tests of this project are run via Travis CI.

Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub
and BitBucket. Travis CI offers several paid plans for private projects and a free plan for open source.

To see the travis configurations you can look into the .travis.yml file, located on the root folder.

### Break down end to end tests

End-to-end testing is a Software testing methodology to test an application flow from start to end. The 
purpose of End to end testing is to simulate the real user scenario and validate the system under test 
and its components for integration and data integrity.

The main reason for carrying out this testing is to determine various dependencies of an application as
well as ensuring that accurate information is communicated between various system components. It is usually
performed after the completion of functional and system testing of any application.
